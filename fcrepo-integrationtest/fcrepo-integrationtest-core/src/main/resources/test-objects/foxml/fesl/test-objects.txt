Test objects

Represents hieararchies of objects and collections as follows:

test:1000000 - collection
  test:1000001 - collection
    test:1000002
    test:1000003
    test:1000004
    test:1000005
  test:1000006 - collection
    test:1000007
    test:1000008
    test:1000009
    test:1000010
    test:1000011
    test:1000012
    
Objects are used in relationship-based resource attribute policies and tests for these.

Objects have the following relationship-based attributes:

DC Datastream state Active (A)
  test:1000000 thru test:1000007
DC Datstream state Deleted (D)
  test:10000008 thru test:1000012

Object state Active (A)
  test:1000000 thru test:1000003 and test:1000010 thru test:1000012
Object state Deleted (D)
  test:1000004 thru test:1000009

dc:subject values include;
  "divisible-by-two" if the pid (excluding the namespace) is divisible by two
  "divisible-by-three" if the pid (excluding the namespace) is divisible by three
eg
  test:1000000 has dc:subject divisible-by-two
  test:1000002 has dc:subject divisble-by-two and dc:subject divisible-by-3
  
  Also test:1000001 and test:1000006 also have a dc:subject value of "dummy"
  and test:1000009 has a blank dc:subject entry (eg <dc:subject/>
